## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

I used this project to practice Sass. I set up Sass using the Sass command line to link the scss and css files and to watch the files. Additionally, I set up a Sass Function to convert px to rem, or px to em; and used it throught the project.

### Continued development

My intention is to work through the Learning Paths to continue gaining experiance setting up projects and completing them. Javascript is an ongoing challenge for me, I plan to start learning React when I feel more comfortable with using vanilla Javascript.
